# Assignment2-Ethereum

Handin of mandatory assignment 2

Inspiration taken from the simple banking solidity example and  *https://github.com/rogargon/simple_bank*

In this github you'll find a Banking.sol file, which contains the banking smart contract.

You'll find a Merge file, used to merge the Banking file.

And a Javascript test file, which contains tests which checks that the smart contract works correctly.

It's initially set up using Truffle, and I've used Ganache as the local network.
